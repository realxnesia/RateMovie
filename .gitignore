python
or you can just

## CocoaPods GitIgnore Template

# CocoaPods - Only use to conserve bandwidth / Save time on Pushing
#           - Also handy if you have a large number of dependant pods
#           - AS PER https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html NEVER IGNORE THE

dependencies.

# CocoaPods
# We recommend against adding the Pods directory to your .gitignore. However
# you should judge for yourself, the pros and cons are mentioned at:
# 
https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/using-cocoapods.html#should-i-check-the-pods-directory-into-source-control

# Add this line if you want to avoid checking in source code from the Xcode workspace

# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo.
# Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the screenshots whenever they are needed.
